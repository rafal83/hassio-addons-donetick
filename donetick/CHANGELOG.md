- **Group By and Section Persistence**: Persisted the "group by" setting in the main view. If you select "group by due date," "priority," etc., this setting will be preserved. When you return to donetick from the same device, you will see the same grouping. Additionally, the collapsed/expanded state of sections is now persisted.
- **Rolling Chore Due Date Logic**: Added logic to ensure the next due date for rolling chores is the later of the completed date or the originally calculated next due date, particularly for day-of-the-month scheduling.

  The main view now includes a side calendar where you can easily see all your scheduled tasks (both assigned to you and others in your circle).  

- **Updated Configuration Loading**:  
  Added support for environment-specific overrides.  

- **API Support**:  
  You can now create tasks and chores via the API.  

- **Points System Upgrade**:  
  Introduced the ability to redeem points!  

- **Task in sentence**: I am excited about this one specifically. the focus is to minimize the click and field switching when creating a task. You would click the input field and type everything into one sentence. Donetick will attempt to parse the details and will show the modal to show you what has been processed
You will open Donetick. click on the top field and type the task once you are done press enter. and task created. you can set due dates, recurrent tasks, and priorities all in one shot.
> [!WARNING]
> This may cause tasks to fail to be scheduled or created properly. If you encounter this issue, please open an issue in the repository.


  **Usage:**  
  - **Priority**: For the highest priority, use any of the following keywords: `P1`, `Urgent`, `Important`, or `ASAP`.  
    Use `P2`, `P3`, or `P4` for lower priorities.  
  -  **Due date**: Specify dates with phrases like tomorrow, next week, Monday, or   August 1st at 12 pm.
  -  **Frequency/Reccurent**: Set recurring tasks with terms like daily, weekly, monthly,  yearly, or patterns such as every Tuesday and Thursday.
